Word Power :

Word power is the ability of being able to communicate in an appropriate manner. It is an art to be able to use the right vocabulary at the right place in the right tone so that one is able to convey a message to the other without any misunderstandings.
Words have the power to change wrong mind sets and attitudes. If you convey right then there are 90% chances that the other will receive right. The 10% goes to the part where the second person doesn't want to understand. Word power doesn't refer to having a very high level vocabulary that might only Shakespeare understand. It means that at least you have the words that can effectively help you speak and express yourself.

Politicians, in today's world, are a great example of what the power of speech is . These people are supposed to address millions with a ten or fifteen minute speech. "Narendra Modi" is the best example of how the right communication is the language of leadership. When a person can express his exact feelings through words, then there are minimal chances that he will fail to make the second person understand. Not only expressing what you feel, but at times, if you do not want to tell what you feel and rather you are able to manipulate in the correct way, in order to win, it is another level of art.

"UP CM terms Ram Gopal Yadav's Pulwama remarks 'shameful'."
This statement is an in-short of how UP's chief minister was annoyed by the remarks made by Ram Gopal Yadav on the Pulwama attack. These kind of statements that are printed in newspapers on daily basis, are another example. It is not possible for every other individual to shorten incidents into a one line statement  that millions can understand. Writers who have a command on language know how to express and manipulate at the same time. What is written in an inshort might not be the whole story but just an aspect, but it has to appealing enough for the reader to read the entire article.
"I understand English films better than English speakers - says Nawazuddin Siddiqui" - now if he means that he has better command on english or he is able to understand the core meaning of english movies better than those who speak english , who knows?
The news writer could have wrote some other statement for an in short but he chose particularly this statement because it makes the reader want to know more. 

Having a good vocabulary and knowing how to use it while you speak, to know how much you speak and what you speak, its all what you call qualities of speech.  Being able to express is a gift that humans are blessed with, and that is why, every individual should make use of it to the maximum because having the power of words in your hand can help you lead and make you worthy enough of being heard.
